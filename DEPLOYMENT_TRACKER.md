## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues & Blockers

1. **AWS Console Access**: Waiting for admin credentials
2. **MongoDB Atlas**: Need owner permissions for user deletion
3. **Google Cloud**: API key deletion requires project owner
4. **Kubernetes Cluster**: Status unknown, need verification

## üé¨ Next Actions (Priority Order)

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Access AWS, MongoDB, Google consoles
2. **URGENT**: Execute credential rotation commands
3. **HIGH**: Update application .env files
4. **MEDIUM**: Begin Phase 2 Terraform deployment
5. **LOW**: Prepare monitoring dashboards

## üìä Success Metrics

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 4 hours
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 0 data loss
- **MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery)**: < 2 hours per phase
- **Availability Target**: 99.9% during migration
- **Security Score Target**: A+ post-deployment
