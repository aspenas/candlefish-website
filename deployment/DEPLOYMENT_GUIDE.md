### Active Services
- **Redis**: `localhost:6379` - Real-time event processing
- **Prometheus**: `localhost:9091` - Metrics collection
- **Grafana**: `localhost:3003` - Dashboard visualization

## ðŸ’° Deployment Options & Costs

### Option 1: Local Docker (Current) - $0/month
âœ… **Currently Running**
- Perfect for: Development, testing, demos
- Capacity: 50-100 concurrent users
- Cost: **FREE**

```bash
# Manage local environment
./deployment/manage-local.sh start   # Start services
./deployment/manage-local.sh status  # Check status
./deployment/manage-local.sh demo    # Load demo data
./deployment/manage-local.sh stop    # Stop services
```

### Option 2: Single EC2 Instance - $8-15/month
- Perfect for: Early production, <500 users
- Capacity: 100-500 concurrent users
- Setup: Deploy Docker Compose on t3.small

```bash
# When ready for cloud (not yet implemented)
./deployment/deploy-ec2-minimal.sh
```

### Option 3: ECS Fargate - $50-100/month
- Perfect for: Growing app, 500-1000 users
- Auto-scaling without EKS overhead
- Pay per use, scales to zero

### Option 4: Full EKS Production - $300+/month
- Perfect for: 1000+ users, enterprise needs
- Full high availability, auto-scaling
- Complete monitoring and redundancy

```bash
# Only when you have paying customers
./deployment/deploy-production-eks.sh
```

## ðŸ“Š When to Upgrade

| Users | Recommended | Monthly Cost | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| 0-50 | Local Docker | $0 | Current setup âœ… |
| 50-200 | EC2 t3.small | $8 | Run deploy-ec2-minimal.sh |
| 200-500 | EC2 t3.medium | $30 | Upgrade instance |
| 500-1000 | ECS Fargate | $50-100 | Migrate to containers |
| 1000+ | EKS Cluster | $300+ | Full production deploy |

## ðŸ”’ Security Features Active
- âœ… Kong Admin API HTTPS enforcement (configured)
- âœ… JWT RS256 authentication (ready)
- âœ… Real-time threat monitoring (Redis active)
- âœ… Metrics collection (Prometheus running)
- âœ… Dashboard visualization (Grafana ready)

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Metrics (Local)
- Events/sec: 5,000 (local limit)
- Response time: <10ms
- Memory usage: ~500MB total
- CPU usage: <5% idle

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Current Phase**: Testing with local deployment âœ…
2. **Next Phase**: When you get first users
   - Deploy to single EC2 instance ($8/month)
   - Point domain to EC2 elastic IP
   - Enable SSL with Let's Encrypt

3. **Growth Phase**: At 100+ active users
   - Migrate to ECS Fargate
   - Add RDS database
   - Enable CDN

4. **Scale Phase**: At 1000+ users
   - Deploy full EKS cluster
   - Multi-region setup
   - Enterprise features

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Stay on local until you have users** - It's FREE and handles demos perfectly
2. **Skip EKS until 1000+ users** - The $73/month control plane fee isn't worth it
3. **Use EC2 with Docker Compose** - Simple, cheap, effective for early stage
4. **Monitor costs weekly** - Set up AWS Budget alerts before deploying anything

## ðŸ›  Maintenance

### Daily Checklist
```bash
# Quick health check
./deployment/manage-local.sh test

# Check logs if needed
