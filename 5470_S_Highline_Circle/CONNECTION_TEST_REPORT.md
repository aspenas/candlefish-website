# ✅ INVENTORY SYSTEM CONNECTION FIXED

## Status: OPERATIONAL

The inventory system is now working correctly with the following configuration:

### 🖥️ Local Development Setup

| Component | URL | Status |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| **Frontend** | http://localhost:3050 | ✅ Running |
| **Backend API** | http://localhost:4050/api/v1 | ✅ Running |
| **Database** | SQLite (inventory.db) | ✅ 324 items loaded |

### 🔧 What Was Fixed

1. **Frontend Configuration**: Updated to use local backend API (http://localhost:4050/api/v1)
2. **CORS Headers**: Backend properly configured to accept frontend requests
3. **Development Server**: Frontend running on port 3050 with hot reload
4. **Database Connection**: Backend successfully serving 324 inventory items

### 📝 About the Login Issue

The "login" at https://inventory.highline.work is **Netlify's basic auth** (password protection), not the actual JWT authentication system. This is a site-wide password, not user authentication.

To remove Netlify basic auth:
1. Go to Netlify dashboard
2. Navigate to Site settings > Access control
3. Remove password protection

The actual JWT authentication system is implemented in the code but needs to be activated by:
1. Creating user accounts in the database
2. Enabling the login routes
3. Protecting API endpoints with JWT middleware

### 🚀 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start Backend (Terminal 1)
cd /Users/patricksmith/candlefish-ai/5470_S_Highline_Circle/backend
DATABASE_PATH=inventory.db PORT=4050 go run main.go

# Start Frontend (Terminal 2)
cd /Users/patricksmith/candlefish-ai/5470_S_Highline_Circle/frontend
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4050/api/v1 npm run dev -- --port 3050
```
