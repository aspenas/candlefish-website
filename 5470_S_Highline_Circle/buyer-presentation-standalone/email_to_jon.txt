Hi Jon.  Here's the number we came up with for all furnishings: $250,000.

It's based on our actual invoices, discounted to fair resale values. We've attached the complete list of what's included.  For context, this represents the majority of the existing furnishings. General exceptions include our primary bedroom, and select items in various rooms.  

Let us know what you think. Thanks.
