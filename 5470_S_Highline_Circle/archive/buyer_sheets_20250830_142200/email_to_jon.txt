  Jon,

  Here's the number for all furnishings: $275,000

  This is based on our actual invoices and current replacement values. You can view the complete list of what's included here:

  This is our bottom number. It's less than what these pieces are worth individually, but we know you appreciate the design and it saves everyone time.

  Let us know what you think.

  Best,Patrick & Karen
