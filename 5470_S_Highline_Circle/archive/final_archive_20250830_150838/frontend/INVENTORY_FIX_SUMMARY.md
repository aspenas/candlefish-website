# Inventory Page Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The Inventory page at https://inventory.highline.work/inventory was showing skeleton loaders indefinitely because of broken backend endpoints.

## Root Cause
The backend `/filter` endpoint was returning a database error:
```json
{"error":"no such table: item_images"}
```

The `/search` endpoint was also broken with token parsing errors.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. API Service Layer Fix
- Modified `filterItems()` in `/src/services/api.ts` to use the working `/items` endpoint instead of the broken `/filter` endpoint
- Added fallback logic to `searchItems()` that performs client-side search when the server search fails
- Added proper error handling and logging

### 2. Maintained Functionality
- Filtering still works by passing parameters to the `/items` endpoint
- Search functionality works via client-side filtering when server search fails
- All existing UI features remain functional
- Error boundaries prevent crashes

## Endpoints Status
- ✅ `/items` - Working correctly (498 items)
- ✅ `/analytics/summary` - Working correctly  
- ✅ `/rooms` - Working correctly
- ❌ `/filter` - Database error (missing item_images table)
- ❌ `/search` - Token parsing error

## Files Modified
- `/src/services/api.ts` - Added endpoint workarounds and fallback logic
- `/src/pages/Inventory.tsx` - Minor cleanup (main logic moved to API layer)

## Verification
- API endpoints tested successfully
- Inventory page should now load data properly
- Dashboard continues to work (was not affected)
- All 498 items are accessible through the working endpoints

## Next Steps (Backend)
The following backend issues should be addressed:
1. Fix the missing `item_images` table in the database
2. Fix the search endpoint token parsing issue
3. Consider consolidating endpoints to reduce complexity

## Testing
Run the test script to verify endpoints:
```bash
node test-inventory-fix.js
```

The inventory page should now display data instead of showing skeleton loaders indefinitely.
