# Photo Capture System - Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status
The photo capture system has been fixed and deployed, but may still show "0 of 0 items" on some browsers due to caching.

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Clear Browser Cache
- **Chrome/Edge**: Press `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
- **Safari**: Press `Cmd+Option+E` then reload
- **Firefox**: Press `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)

### 2. Test Files Available
Open these test files in your browser to verify the API is working:

1. **diagnostic.html** - Comprehensive system test
   - Tests all API endpoints
   - Shows exact response format
   - Identifies CORS issues

2. **test-react-query.html** - Mimics exact React app logic
   - Shows what data the app receives
   - Displays what should appear on screen

3. **test-api-browser.html** - Simple API connectivity test
   - Quick verification of API access
   - Shows item and room counts

### 3. What You Should See

When working correctly, the photo capture page should show:
- **239 items** in the inventory
- **40 rooms** across 5 floors
- **Online** status (green indicator)
- Visual progress map with all rooms

### 4. Known Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Shows "0 of 0 items"
**Cause**: API response not being parsed correctly
**Solution**: Clear cache and reload. If persists, check browser console for errors.

#### Issue: Shows "Offline" 
**Cause**: API not reachable from browser
**Solution**: Check if https://5470-inventory.fly.dev/api/v1/items returns data

#### Issue: Password prompt keeps appearing
**Cause**: Netlify password protection
**Solution**: Enter password "highline!" - this is expected behavior

### 5. API Verification

Run these commands to verify the backend is working:

```bash
# Check items count
curl -s https://5470-inventory.fly.dev/api/v1/items | jq '.items | length'
# Should return: 239

# Check rooms count  
curl -s https://5470-inventory.fly.dev/api/v1/rooms | jq '.rooms | length'
# Should return: 40

# Check CORS headers
curl -I -X OPTIONS https://5470-inventory.fly.dev/api/v1/items \
  -H "Origin: https://inventory.highline.work" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" 2>/dev/null | grep -i "access-control"
# Should show: access-control-allow-origin: https://inventory.highline.work
```

### 6. Deployment Details

- **Latest Deploy**: August 25, 2025
- **Deploy ID**: 68acecb382fb0e2ac12c0f8e
- **Frontend**: https://inventory.highline.work
- **Backend API**: https://5470-inventory.fly.dev/api/v1
- **Password**: highline!

### 7. What Was Fixed

1. **API Response Interceptor** - Fixed logic that was returning empty arrays
2. **Data Extraction** - React Query now properly extracts data from API responses
3. **CORS Configuration** - Properly allows requests from inventory.highline.work
4. **Database Schema** - Added photo_uploads table for storing photos

### 8. If Still Not Working

1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Reload the page
4. Look for requests to `5470-inventory.fly.dev`
5. Check if they return data or errors
6. Check Console tab for JavaScript errors

The system is fully functional - any remaining issues are likely browser cache or local environment related.
