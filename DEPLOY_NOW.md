# üöÄ IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS

## Step 1: Update GitHub Secrets (2 minutes)

Go to: https://github.com/candlefish-ai/candlefish-ai/settings/secrets/actions

### If secrets exist with "Value" suffix, DELETE them first:
- Delete `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_IDValue` 
- Delete `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEYValue`

### Add/Update these secrets (exact names, NO suffix):

**Secret Name:** `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`

## Step 2: Trigger Deployment (30 seconds)

### Option A: Re-run Failed Workflow
1. Go to: https://github.com/candlefish-ai/candlefish-ai/actions/runs/17283709729
2. Click "Re-run all jobs" button (top right)

### Option B: New Deployment
1. Go to: https://github.com/candlefish-ai/candlefish-ai/actions/workflows/184638683
2. Click "Run workflow" button
3. Select:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Platform: `all`
   - Deployment mode: `autonomous`
   - Use maximum tokens: ‚úÖ (checked)
4. Click green "Run workflow" button

## Step 3: Monitor Deployment

Run this in terminal:
```bash
./scripts/monitor-autonomous-deployment.sh watch
```

Or check manually:
```bash
gh run list --workflow="Autonomous Prompt Engineering Deployment" --limit 1
```

## Expected Timeline

Once triggered, the autonomous deployment will:
1. ‚úÖ Validate AWS Secrets (2 min)
2. üåê Deploy Web Platform to Netlify (10 min)
3. üì± Deploy Mobile Apps via EAS (15 min)
4. üîß Deploy API to AWS Lambda (10 min)
5. üìä Configure Monitoring (5 min)
6. ‚úÖ Run Integration Tests (3 min)

**Total: ~45 minutes**

## Success Indicators

- All GitHub Actions jobs show green checkmarks
- Endpoints respond:
  - Web: https://app.candlefish.ai
  - API: https://api.candlefish.ai/health
- CloudWatch dashboards populated
- DataDog receiving metrics

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails again:
```bash
# Check which step failed
gh run view --log | grep -i error

# View AWS credentials test
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Manual validation
./scripts/monitor-autonomous-deployment.sh health
```
