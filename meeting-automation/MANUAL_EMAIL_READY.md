Hi Erusin, Katie, and Jon ‚Äî

Looking forward to our conversation. Here are the details:

Time: Friday, August 29, 3:00 PM‚Äì4:00 PM MDT
Join Zoom: https://us06web.zoom.us/j/89371686095?pwd=GnmgZnD6dsujCdEjDQjyI4IaVeVgc7.1
Meeting ID: 89371686095

I've also scheduled Read.ai Copilot to join ‚Äî it produces a shared set of notes and highlights we'll all receive after the call.
If you'd prefer not to have it participate, just let me know and I'll disable it.
If you haven't seen the output before, it's surprisingly fun and useful.

I've attached a calendar invite for your convenience.

Best,
Patrick
