## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Stay Within Free Tier (First 62,000 emails)
- Monitor daily sending to stay under 2,000 emails/day
- Batch non-urgent emails to optimize sending patterns
- Use email templates to reduce processing overhead

### 2. Efficient Bounce/Complaint Handling
- Implement suppression lists to avoid sending to invalid addresses
- Monitor bounce rates (target < 5%)
- Monitor complaint rates (target < 0.1%)
- Use SNS + Lambda for automated list management (serverless = minimal cost)

### 3. CloudWatch Logs Optimization
- Set retention period to 30 days for SES logs
- Use log filters to reduce storage of verbose logs
- Archive old logs to S3 for long-term storage (cheaper)

### 4. Reserved Capacity (Future Option)
- Consider dedicated IP only when sending > 100,000 emails/month
- Dedicated IPs improve deliverability for high-volume senders
- Cost: $24.95/month per IP
