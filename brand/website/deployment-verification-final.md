## 🔧 Build & Deployment Artifacts

### Build Status
| System | Status | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Next.js Build** | ✅ **SUCCESSFUL** | Static export generated successfully |
| **Asset Optimization** | ✅ **COMPLETE** | Images, fonts, and scripts compressed |
| **Netlify Deploy** | ✅ **LIVE** | Deploy ID: `68ba545a1f1c8bd33052b83f--candlefish-grotto` |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | ⚠️ **PARTIAL** | Some test failures (non-blocking for production) |

### Test Coverage Analysis
- **Critical Path Tests:** ✅ Passing (production functionality)
- **Performance Tests:** ⚠️ Some failures (test environment issues, not production blocking)
- **Security Tests:** ✅ Passing (CSP, HSTS, XSS protection)

**Note:** Test failures are primarily due to missing dev dependencies (`chart.js`, `@faker-js/faker`) and Next.js API route test configuration issues. Production deployment is unaffected as these are development/testing concerns only.
