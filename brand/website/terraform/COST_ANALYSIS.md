## Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Compute Cost Optimization

**Spot Instance Strategy**:
- **Development**: 100% Spot instances (70% cost reduction)
- **Staging**: 70% Spot, 30% On-Demand (49% cost reduction)
- **Production**: 0% Spot (reliability over cost)

```hcl
# Example spot configuration
capacity_provider_strategy {
  capacity_provider = "FARGATE_SPOT"
  weight           = var.environment == "production" ? 0 : 70
  base            = 0
}
```

**Right-sizing Strategy**:
- Development: Minimal resources (256 CPU, 512 MB)
- Staging: Medium resources (512 CPU, 1024 MB)
- Production: Optimized scaling (2048 CPU, 4096 MB base)

### 2. Storage Cost Optimization

**S3 Intelligent Tiering**:
```hcl
lifecycle_rules = {
  transition_to_ia_days      = 30
  transition_to_glacier_days = 90
  expiration_days           = var.environment == "dev" ? 180 : 0
}
```

**DynamoDB Optimization**:
- Development: Pay-per-request billing
- Staging: Pay-per-request with higher limits
- Production: Provisioned with auto-scaling

**Database Strategy**:
- Development: ElastiCache only (no Aurora)
- Staging: Aurora Serverless v2 (0.5-2.0 ACU)
- Production: Aurora Global Database with auto-scaling

### 3. Network Cost Optimization

**NAT Gateway Strategy**:
- Development: Single NAT Gateway ($45/month savings)
- Staging: Multi-AZ NAT Gateways
- Production: Multi-AZ + multi-region

**VPC Endpoints**:
Reduce NAT Gateway data transfer costs by $50-100/month:
```hcl
vpc_endpoints = {
  s3 = { service = "s3", vpc_endpoint_type = "Gateway" }
  dynamodb = { service = "dynamodb", vpc_endpoint_type = "Gateway" }
  ecr_dkr = { service = "ecr.dkr", vpc_endpoint_type = "Interface" }
}
```

### 4. Monitoring Cost Optimization

**Tiered Log Retention**:
- Development: 7 days ($20/month savings)
- Staging: 14 days
- Production: 30 days

**Selective Monitoring**:
- Development: Basic CloudWatch only

- Production: Full observability suite

## Cost Monitoring and Alerting

### Budget Configuration

```hcl
budgets = {
  dev_monthly_budget = {
    limit_amount = 100
    notifications = [
      { threshold = 80, type = "ACTUAL" },
      { threshold = 100, type = "FORECASTED" }
    ]
  }
  
  staging_monthly_budget = {
    limit_amount = 400
    notifications = [
      { threshold = 80, type = "ACTUAL" },
      { threshold = 120, type = "FORECASTED" }
    ]
  }
  
  production_monthly_budget = {
    limit_amount = 1500
    notifications = [
      { threshold = 90, type = "ACTUAL" },
      { threshold = 110, type = "FORECASTED" }
