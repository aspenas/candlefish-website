DOCUMENT PROCESSING CAPABILITY:
- Process up to 500K tokens of document content simultaneously
- Extract patterns across multiple document types
- Identify contradictions and gaps
- Correlate information across sources
- Generate quantified improvement opportunities

CRITICAL REMINDER: Never analyze documents from financial services organizations (banks, insurance, investment firms).

## Implementation Note

This document analysis framework enables the Candlefish system to transform massive amounts of unstructured organizational documentation into actionable insights worth millions in operational improvements. 

Key capabilities:
1. Process up to 1000 pages simultaneously
2. Extract patterns across document types
3. Identify contradictions and gaps
4. Quantify improvement opportunities
5. Generate executive-ready reports

The system continuously learns from each analysis, building an ever-improving pattern library that makes future assessments faster and more accurate. This creates tremendous value for operators who can quickly demonstrate expertise by surfacing insights that would take traditional consultants weeks to discover.

Remember: Every document tells a story about operational maturity. Our job is to read between the lines, connect the dots, and translate that story into transformation opportunities worth millions.
