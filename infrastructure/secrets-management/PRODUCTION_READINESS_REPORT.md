   - Multiple scripts contain test credentials
   ```
   **Impact**: Severe security vulnerability  
   **Action**: Immediate credential rotation and removal

2. **AWS Integration Failure (CRITICAL)**
   - AWS credentials not properly configured

3. **Production Secrets Missing (CRITICAL)**
   - No secrets retrievable from AWS Secrets Manager
   - Secret versioning not working
   - Rotation mechanisms not operational
   
   **Impact**: System cannot function in production  
   **Action**: Deploy and populate secret store

### ⚠️ Issues Requiring Resolution

1. **Vault Configuration**
   - HashiCorp Vault not configured
   - Transit encryption layer unavailable
   - PKI/Certificate management not set up

2. **Emergency Procedures**
   - Missing break-glass scripts
   - No backup restoration procedures
   - Limited disaster recovery testing

3. **Monitoring and Alerting**
   - CloudWatch alarms not configured
   - SNS notification topics missing
   - Limited operational visibility

4. **SDK Dependencies**
   - AWS SDK dependency missing in TypeScript SDK
   - Configuration management incomplete

## Security Assessment

### Current Security Posture: HIGH RISK

#### Immediate Threats
1. **Exposed AWS Credentials**: Found hardcoded in multiple files
2. **Insecure File Permissions**: .env.production has 644 permissions
3. **Version Control Exposure**: Credentials may be in git history

#### Security Recommendations
1. **Immediate**: Rotate all exposed credentials
2. **High Priority**: Implement proper secrets management for deployment scripts
3. **Medium Priority**: Set up proper monitoring and alerting
4. **Ongoing**: Regular security scanning and auditing

---

## Production Deployment Blockers

### Must Fix Before Production

1. **Configure AWS Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   # Required AWS setup:
   - KMS keys for encryption
   - Secrets Manager with proper secrets
   - IAM roles and policies
   - CloudWatch alarms and SNS topics
   ```

2. **Security Remediation**
   ```bash
   # Critical security fixes:
   - Remove hardcoded credentials from all files
   - Implement proper credential management
   - Set secure file permissions (600) on sensitive files
   - Audit git history for exposed secrets
   ```

3. **Complete Integration Testing**
   ```bash
   # Integration requirements:
   - End-to-end secret lifecycle testing
   - Vault connectivity and authentication
   - Emergency procedure validation
   - Performance and scale testing
   ```

### Nice to Have

1. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Comprehensive dashboard setup
   - Advanced alerting rules
   - Performance metrics collection

2. **Automation**
   - Automated secret rotation
   - Self-healing capabilities
   - Advanced backup strategies
