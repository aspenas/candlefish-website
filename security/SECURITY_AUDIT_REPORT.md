## Code Snippets

### Example: Secure API Endpoint
```python
from security.auth.middleware import authenticate, authorize, validate_input, rate_limit
from security.auth.rbac import Permission

@app.route('/api/config/<config_id>', methods=['GET'])
@authenticate
@authorize(Permission.CONFIG_READ)
@rate_limit(max_requests=100, window=60)
@validate_input({
    'config_id': {'type': 'uuid', 'required': True}
})
def get_config(config_id):
    # Secure implementation
    pass
```

### Example: Encrypted Configuration Storage
```python
from security.core import EncryptionManager, SecretsManager

# Initialize security
encryption = EncryptionManager()
secrets = SecretsManager()

# Store configuration securely
config_data = {
    'database': secrets.get_database_credentials('production'),
    'api_keys': secrets.get_api_key('external_service')
}

# Encrypt before storage
encrypted = encryption.encrypt(config_data, context='production-config')
```
