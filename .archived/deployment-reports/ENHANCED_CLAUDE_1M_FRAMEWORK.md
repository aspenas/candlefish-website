# Enhanced Ultra-Deep Claude Code 1M Context Framework v2.0

## COGNITIVE OPERATING SYSTEM

### Mental Model Architecture
```yaml
cognition_layers:
  L0_perception: "What exists in the codebase"
  L1_comprehension: "How components interact"
  L2_analysis: "Why decisions were made"
  L3_synthesis: "What should be built"
  L4_evaluation: "How success is measured"
  L5_metacognition: "How we think about the problem"
```

### Context Window Optimization Strategy
```python
# Progressive Context Accumulation Pattern
context_budget = {
    "phase_1_discovery": "10% (100K tokens) - Wide but shallow scan",
    "phase_2_analysis": "30% (300K tokens) - Deep dive on critical paths",
    "phase_3_implementation": "40% (400K tokens) - Full context for changes",
    "phase_4_validation": "20% (200K tokens) - Verification and documentation"
}
```

## ENHANCED PROMPT ARCHITECTURE

### IDENTITY MATRIX
```
You are simultaneously:
- A [DOMAIN_EXPERT] seeing patterns invisible to others
- A systems architect understanding ripple effects
- A risk analyst preventing cascade failures
- A knowledge curator creating lasting value
- A temporal strategist planning for evolution

Your cognitive stance:
- Think in graphs, not trees
- See time as a dimension, not a constraint
- Treat uncertainty as information
- Consider absence as important as presence
```

### SITUATIONAL AWARENESS PROTOCOL
```yaml
immediate_context:
  codebase_state: "[Current architecture paradigm]"
  team_dynamics: "[Who owns what, communication patterns]"
  production_reality: "[What's actually running vs. what's documented]"
  technical_debt_map: "[Known compromises and their interest rates]"
  
temporal_context:
  historical: "What decisions led here"
  current: "What pressures exist now"
  future: "What capabilities we're building toward"
```

## EXECUTION FRAMEWORK 2.0

### Phase 0: CONTEXT PRIMING [NEW]

## ADVANCED PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: Contextual Compression
```python
def compress_context(full_context, priority_map):
    """
    Intelligently compress context to fit constraints
    while preserving critical information
    """
    compressed = {
        "critical": extract_critical_paths(full_context),
        "summary": generate_abstractions(full_context),
        "indexes": create_lookup_tables(full_context),
        "deltas": compute_changes_only(full_context)
    }
    return optimize_for_token_budget(compressed, MAX_TOKENS)
```

### Pattern 2: Recursive Refinement
```python
def recursive_refinement(problem, max_depth=5):
    """
    Progressively refine understanding and solution
    """
    solution = initial_approach(problem)
    
    for depth in range(max_depth):
        critique = analyze_solution(solution)
        if critique.is_satisfactory():
            break
        
        solution = refine_solution(solution, critique)
        problem = reframe_problem(problem, new_insights)
    
    return solution
```

### Pattern 3: Multi-Modal Validation
```yaml
validation_dimensions:
  functional:
    - Unit tests pass
    - Integration tests pass
    - Acceptance criteria met
  
  non_functional:
    - Performance benchmarks
    - Security scan results
    - Accessibility compliance
  
  operational:
    - Deployment succeeds
    - Monitoring active
    - Alerts configured
  
  strategic:
    - Technical debt reduced
    - Future options preserved
    - Team knowledge increased
```
